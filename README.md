# AdaShips
AdaShip is a two-player, turn based game of sea warfare.


# Summary and review of the problem, overall proposed solution:
AdaShip is a game that's played on a CLI(command-line interface). The game consists of a player vs a computer. The computer and the player take turns to input a coordinate into the terminal and try to guess if a boat was placed there. The game continues until the computer or the player has no more ships on the board. The player would be able to set up the boats on the board using the terminal, the terminal allows the player to input if they want the boat vertically or horizontally and where the player wants the boat to be rendered. The computer would randomly place the ship on the computer board and also use an AI to fire torpedoes to the player's board. The game prevents the user from inputting the wrong values.


My solution was to create two boards using 2D arrays. It would allow me to push the new values to the matrix easily and effectively. The program allows the user to input a coordinate and then render the boat in that position using a while loop. When the user inputs a value into the program it validates the input and it will ask for input again. I have a menu with instructions for the user. The program runs until a player or the computer has no more ships on the board or the player has quit the game.

# UML style diagram illustrating initial overall solution:

My UML represents how my code works and how they function are related to each other. As my code doesn't have classes 
I didn't use classes or serrated the code into files. The UML is a way to visualize the way the code works.

# Initial working plan, overall approach, development strategy and approach to quality:
My strategy was to divide and conquer as if I break down the problem into small components it would allow me to work more efficiently. I started to do some research and then build a small prototype and then made the prototype more efficient and robust.

I made a flowchart to help me visualize the program and what components I would need to create to meet the passing criteria. From the flowchart, I was able to see I would need two separate boards and small components such as placing the boats and firing the torpedoes.

My approach to quality was to make my family members use the program and test the robustness and usability. From that user testing, I kept improving the program making it more robust and making the menu more user friendly. The sessions help me understand the problems that a user would have when using the program as a developer my mind would automatically know what to do but see it from a user perspective help me with quality.


# Analysis and decomposition of the overall problem into key ‚Äòepic‚Äô style tasks:
I read the assignment and extracted the requirements I would need to do.
I made a requirement list and I followed that requirement list until I had a prototype.
I worked in an agile environment so I kept improving my solution every time, you can see this in my GitHub commits.

- First Set up boats for each player 
- Turns for each player shooting torpedoes 
- The game is won once a player has not boats left 
- Record the location of the boats and shot that was hit or miss
- The location is going to  be like A4 or F4

####  -------------Boats----------------
    Carrier - Length 5
    Battleship - Length 4
    Destroyer - Length 3
    Submarine - Length 3
    Patrol Boat - Length 2

#### -----------(player v computer)----------
The real player set up the board first  and the computer should do it automatically
The AI should be able to fire torpedoes at the opponent 
We need to indicate if ships are sunk or not

####  ------------------------Pass Criteria--------------------
- Should be able to  read ‚Äòadaship_config.ini‚Äô and get this information:
Board: 10x10
Boat: Carrier, 5
Boat: Battleship, 4
Boat: Destroyer, 3
Boat: Submarine, 3
Boat: Patrol Boat, 2

- Set up an interface 
- Menu 
- Place the ships on the board 
- Indicate where the ship is
- function that detects if boats are in the same place 
- Support reset game and quit the game
- Continue button to  start the game after placements
- Place ships in random places with  strategies
- Turns should be done for player and computer
